    flatzip(dataset_1, dataset_2, ...)

Helper to zip together multiple collections of parameter lists into a single
collection.

# Description
Combines the inner arrays of the different test data types, iterates over them,
and merges those arrays of each iteration into a single, new array.
This allows to reuse test data for functions of various input types.

# Example
```jldoctest
julia> flatzip( \\
    # Test data type (each inner array represents different values) \\
    [[1, 2, 3], [7, 8, 9],    [13, 14, 15]], \\
    # Different test data type (each inner array represents different values) \\
    [[4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [16, 17, 18]], \\
)
3-element Array{Array{Int,1},1}:
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
 [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]
```
