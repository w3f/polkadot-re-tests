\section{Candidate Selection}
\label{sect-primary-validation}

Collators produce candidates (Def. \ref{defn-candidate}) and send those to
validators. Validators verify the validity of the received candidates (Algo.
\ref{algo-primary-validation}) by executing the validation code, $R_{\rho}$, and
issue statements (Def. \ref{defn-gossip-statement}) about the candidates to
connected peers. The validator ensures the that every candidate considered for
inclusion has at least one other validator backing it. Candidates without
backing are discarded.
\newline

The validator must keep track of which candidates were submitted by collators, including
which validators back those candidates in order to penalize bad behavior. This is described
in more detail in section \ref{sect-primary-validaty-announcement}
\newline

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-candidate}
  A \textbf{candidate}, $C_{coll}(PoV_B)$, is issues by collators and contains the PoV
  block and enough data in order for any validator to verify its validity. A
  candidate is a tuple of the following format:
  \[
  C_{coll}(PoV_B) := (id_p, h_b({B_{^{relay}_{parent}}}), id_{C}, Sig^{Collator}_{SR25519}, head(B), h_b({PoV_B}))
  \]

  where each value represents:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $id_p$: the Parachain Id this candidate is for.
    \item $h_b({B_{^{relay}_{parent}}})$: the hash of the relay chain block that this
    candidate should be executed in the context of.
    \item $id_C$: the Collator relay-chain account ID as defined in Definition
    \todo{@fabio}.
    \item $Sig^{Collator}_{SR25519}$: the signature on the 256-bit Blake2 hash
    of the block data by the collator.
    \item $head(B)$: the head data (Def. \ref{defn-head-data}) of block $B$.
    \item $h_b({PoV_B})$: the 32-byte Blake2 hash of the PoV block.
  \end{itemize}

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-head-data}
  The \textbf{head data}, $head(B)$, of a parachain block is a tuple of the following format:
  \[
    head(B) := (H_i(B), H_p(B), H_r(B))
  \]

  Where $H_i(B)$ is the block number of parachain block $B$, $H_p(B)$ is the
  32-byte Blake2 hash of the parent block header and $H_r(B)$ represents the
  root of the post-execution state.
  \todo{@fabio: clarify if $H_p$ is the hash of the header or full block}
  \todo{@fabio: maybe define those symbols at the start (already defined in the Host spec)?}
\end{definition}

    \State Else return success, the new header data $h_B$ and the outgoing messages $M$. \todo{@fabio: same as head data?}
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Candidate Backing}
\label{sect-primary-validaty-announcement}

Validators back the validity respectively the invalidity of candidates by
extending those into candidate receipts as defined in Definition
\ref{defn-candidate-receipt} and communicate those receipts by issuing
statements as defined in Definition \ref{defn-gossip-statement}. Validator $v$
needs to perform Algorithm \ref{algo-primary-validation-announcement} to
announce the statement of primary validation to the Polkadot network. If the
validator receives a statement from another validator, the candidate is
confirmed based on algorithm \ref{algo-endorse-candidate-receipt}.
\newline

As algorithm \ref{algo-primary-validation-announcement} and
\ref{algo-endorse-candidate-receipt} clarifies, the validator should blacklist
collators which send invalid candidates and announce this misbehavior. If
another validator claims that an invalid candidates is actually valid, that
misbehavior must be announced, too. \todo{@fabio}
\newline

The validator tries to back as many candidates as it can, but does not attempt to prioritize
specific candidates. Each validator decides on its own - on whatever metric - which candidate
will ultimately get included in the block.

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-candidate-receipt}
  A \textbf{candidate receipt}, $C_{receipt}(PoV_B)$, is an extension of a candidate
  as defined in Definition \ref{defn-candidate} which includes additional
  information about the validator which verified the PoV block. The candidate
  receipt is communicated to other validators by issuing a statement as defined
  in Definition \ref{defn-gossip-statement}.
  \newline

  This type is a tuple of the following format:
  \[
  C_{receipt}(PoV_B) := (id_p, h_b({B_{^{relay}_{parent}}}), head(B), id_{C}, Sig^{Collator}_{SR25519}, h_b({PoV_B}), Blake2b(CC(PoV_B)))
  \]

  where each value represents:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $id_p$: the Parachain Id this candidate is for.
    \item $h_b({B_{^{relay}_{parent}}})$: the hash of the relay chain block that this
    candidate should be executed in the context of.
    \item $head(B)$: the head data (Def. \ref{defn-head-data}) of block $B$.
    \todo{@fabio (collator module relevant?)}.
    \item $id_C$: the collator relay-chain account ID as defined in Definition
    \todo{@fabio}.
    \item $Sig^{Collator}_{SR25519}$: the signature on the 256-bit Blake2 hash
    of the block data by the collator.
    \item $h_b({PoV_B})$: the hash of the PoV block.
    \item $Blake2b(CC(PoV_B))$: The hash of the commitments made as a result of
    validation, as defined in Definition \ref{defn-candidate-commitments}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-candidate-commitments}
  \textbf{Candidate commitments}, $CC(PoV_B)$, are results of the execution and validation of
  parachain (or parathread) candidates whose produced values must be committed
  to the relay chain. A candidate commitments is represented as a tuple of the following format:
  \begin{alignat*}{2}
    CC(PoV_B) &:= (\mathbb{F}, Enc_{SC}(Msg_0, .., Msg_n), H_r(B), Option(R_\rho)) \\
    Msg &:= (\mathbb{O}, Enc_{SC}(b_0,.. b_n))
  \end{alignat*}

  where each value represents:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathbb{F}$: fees paid from the chain to the relay chain validators.
    \item $Msg$: parachain messages to the relay chain. $\mathbb{O}$ identifies
    the origin of the messages and is a varying data type (Def.
    \ref{defn-scale-codec}) and can be one of the following values:
    \begin{equation*}
      \mathbb{O} =
      \begin{cases}
        0, & \text{Signed} \\
        1, & \text{Parachain} \\
        2, & \text{Root}
      \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    \todo{@fabio: define the concept of "origin"}

    The following SCALE encoded array, $Enc_{SC}(b_0,.. b_n)$, contains the raw
    bytes of the message which varies in size.
    \item $H_r(B)$: the root of a block's erasure encoding Merkle tree
    \todo{@fabio: use different symbol for this?}.
    \item $Option(R_\rho)$: A varying datatype (Def. \ref{defn-scale-codec})
    containing the new runtime code for the parachain.
    \todo{@fabio: clarify further}
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-pov-block}
  A \textbf{Gossip PoV block} is a tuple of the following format:
  \[
  (h_b(B_{^{relay}_{parent}}), h_b(C_{coll}(PoV_B)), PoV_B)
  \]
  where $h_b(B_{^{relay}_{parent}})$ is the block hash of the relay chain being
  referred to and $h_b(C_{coll}(PoV_B))$ is the hash of some candidate localized
  to the same Relay chain block.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-gossip-statement}
  A \textbf{statement} notifies other validators about the validity of a PoV block.
  This type is a tuple of the following format:
  \[
  (Stmt, id_{\mathbb{V}}, Sig^{Valdator}_{SR25519})
  \]
  where $Sig^{Validator}_{SR25519}$ is the signature of the validator and
  $id_{\mathbb{V}}$ refers to the index of validator according to the authority
  set. \todo{@fabio: define authority set (specified in the Host spec)}. $Stmt$
  refers to a statement the validator wants to make about a certain candidate.
  $Stmt$ is a varying data type (Def. \ref{defn-scale-codec}) and can be one of
  the following values:

  \begin{equation*}
    Stmt =
    \begin{cases}
      0, & \text{Seconded, followed by: } C_{receipt}(PoV_B) \\
      1, & \text{Validity, followed by: } Blake2(C_{coll}(PoV_B)) \\
      2, & \text{Invalidity, followed by: } Blake2(C_{coll}(PoV_B))
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}

  The main semantic difference between `Seconded` and `Valid` comes from the fact
  that every validator may second only one candidate per relay chain block; this
  places an upper bound on the total number of candidates whose validity needs to
  be checked. A validator who seconds more than one parachain candidate per relay
  chain block is subject to slashing.
  \newline

  Validation does not directly create a seconded statement, but is rather upgraded
  by the validator when it choses to back a valid candidate as described in
  Algorithm \ref{algo-primary-validation-announcement}.
