# Polkadot Host Specification

Here your can find the latest version of the ![Polkadot Host Specification](./host-spec.pdf)

Please refer to ![Change log](./CHANGELOG.org) to review the history of changes to the spec.

Due to evolving nature of the protocol, to help the reader with identifying updates since last master released, those changes are marked in "green" (new version) vs "red" (old version) in ![host-spec-diffed-updates.pdf](./host-spec-diffed-updates.pdf).

## Editing

The specification is edited with [TeXmacs](https://www.texmacs.org/) with an
additional style package `algorithmacs-style.ts` (from
https://github.com/w3f/algorithmacs) that must be copied or
linked to your personal style package directory `$HOME/.TeXmacs/packages`. The
`.tex` and `.pdf` files are exported from TeXmacs.
