	abstract = {Building trustless cross-blockchain trading protocols is challenging. Centralized exchanges thus remain the preferred route to execute transfers across blockchains. However, these services require trust and therefore undermine the very nature of the blockchains on which they operate. To overcome this, several decentralized exchanges have recently emerged which offer support for atomic cross-chain swaps (ACCS). ACCS enable the trustless exchange of cryptocurrencies across blockchains, and are the only known mechanism to do so. However, ACCS suffer signiﬁcant limitations; they are slow, inefﬁcient and costly, meaning that they are rarely used in practice.},

They try to provide a guide for Masters' students to get through the vast literature on elliptic curves, without getting lost on their way to learning isogeny based cryptography. They are by no means a reference text on the theory of elliptic curves, nor on cryptography; students are encouraged to complement these notes with some of the books recommended in the bibliography. The presentation is divided in three parts, roughly corresponding to the three lectures given. In an effort to keep the reader interested, each part alternates between the fundamental theory of elliptic curves, and applications in cryptography. We often prefer to have the main ideas flow smoothly, rather than having a rigorous presentation as one would have in a more classical book. The reader will excuse us for the inaccuracies and the omissions.},
